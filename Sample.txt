## Complex Questions for Testing Accuracy and Precision


**1. Actor Reach:**

* Find actors who have appeared in shows with an average rating above 4 stars and which were released after 2020. (Join netflix, netflix_cast, netflix_directors and filter by rating and date)

**2. Genre vs. Release Year:**

* Analyze the distribution of shows across different genres for each release year since 2010. (Join netflix and netflix_genre with aggregation by release year)

**3. Long vs. Short Shows by Country:**

* Compare the average duration of movies (type = 'Movie') and TV shows (type = 'TV Show') across different countries. (Join netflix and netflix_country with aggregation by type and country)

**4. Genre Popularity by Region:**

* Analyze the popularity of different genres (by show count) in each country where Netflix operates. (Join netflix, netflix_genre, and netflix_country)

These questions involve complex joins, filtering based on multiple criteria, and potentially aggregation. They will test your LLM model's ability to translate user intent into accurate and precise SQL queries that retrieve the desired data.
